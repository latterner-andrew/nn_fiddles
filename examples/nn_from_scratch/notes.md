## neural net from scratch demo 

### goals 

1. implement a neural net from the ground up... 
    - in R: just using base R + `ggplot2::` for visualization 
    - in Python: just using standard lib + `numpy` for data structures 
2. use the nn to classify some data
    - binary clf with simulated moons data (predict label form two input features) 
    - multiclass clf with nba player-level data (predict position from many inputs)
3. visualize model predictions in a useful way
    - plot decision boundary for 2-feature problem (moons)
    - smthg else for higher-dimensional problem (nba, need to think)
4. illustrate how different hyperparams affect model performance 
    - learning rate, num hidden layers, num training iters, others(?) 
5. summarize clf process in prose
    - describe the network structure and what data structs correspond to what 
    - describe each step of training algo implementation, explaining relevant math 
    - discuss similarity/diff btwn this and DLwP workflow/steps 
    - be sure to point out def'ns of common technical terms, their roles, etc. 


### notes/links 

- the nn implementation for this ex is based on these walkthrus: 
    - [main ref (in r)](https://selbydavid.com/2018/01/09/neural-network/)
    - [another nice implementation (in py)](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/) -- and [accompanying github repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch) 
    - [same implementation in r + py for comparison](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-and-r/)
- data sources: 
    - simmed 2-feature data -- generated by `mlbench::mlbench.spirals()` 
    - bball player data -- scraped from fox sports(?), ca. 2015 


### `TODO` 

- consolidate + clean source files, eliminate duplication, etc. 
- write outline for final nb
- specify exact set of source files + data input files 
- specify what plots will get generated + in what format/medium (e.g. gif?) 
- clean up all code for this ex (just copied from old fiddle folder)
- nice plotting function for fast experimentation 
- full walkthru spirals example 
- python implementation + walkthru side-by-side 
- finish bball clf example (just R or just Py -- no need for both)
- package everything into a nb format 
- add some prose commentary 
- add some useful refs (citing source blog posts prominently)
